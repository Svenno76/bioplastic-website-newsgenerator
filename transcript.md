# Historian Tom Holland: Islam, Christianity & the West - YouTube

## Full Transcript

We are living through a great choke
point in the history of this country.
What you saw in 2020 and its aftermath
was a deeply Christian movement. The
institutional character of Christianity
is is is often rejected as part of the
problem of part of what has to be
rejected. Even though it is that
institutional structure that has
provided people with the ideological
framework that enables them to judge it
as evil. Essentially what Christianity
has that Islam does not is a concept of
the secular. Islam is a a totalizing way
of leading your life. I think Islam is
uniquely indigestible for a a secular
mindset and people don't want to admit
that.

>> Tom Holland, welcome back to
Trigonometry.
>> Thanks very much for having me back.
>> Uh, it's been a while. It's great to
have you back on the show. In the
meantime, by the way, you and Dominic,
who's also a recent guest of ours, have
had tremendous success. So,
congratulations on the rest is history.
It's absolutely crushing. How are you
handling your new found fame?
>> Oh, I'm struggling. I'm really
struggling. It's amazing. I mean, it um
we never in a million years imagined
that there was quite the appetite for
history that there is. Um, and so I'm
happy not just for myself, not just for
Dominic, but for um, history lovers
everywhere that they can be reassured
that history it really does seem to to
kinda tick people's boxes in a way
that I had never ever expected that it
did. Well, there are a lot of memes
online that by the time you're 40 years
old, if you're male, this is a man by
the time he's 40, he's either going to
pick World War II or Roman history.
Like, you don't have a choice really. We
like both. So, it's great to have you
on. It's good to know.
>> I think the the meme I was that um no
male after the age of 40 reads a novel
and so maybe they turn to not to to
non-fiction and history perhaps is a
kinda obvious
>> and I kinda slightly sense that in
myself. I read far fewer novels than I
did.
>> That's really true actually because I
used to I used to read I was quite a
voracious reader of novels and the older
I get the more I veer towards
non-fiction.
>> Yeah. So I I was um chair of the society
of the authors and they prepared a
report on this the gender imbalance how
it operated um and they kinda they dug
into the stats and it was genuinely the
case that the older men get the less
likely they are to read fiction um which
as a non-fiction writer was obviously
good news for me.
>> It is indeed. Well, look, it's great to
have you on. Um, your your last book,
Dominions, we we talked about it last
time, uh, but it's something we want to
come back to a little bit in this
conversation to talk about, uh, the
history of of Christianity, but also
Islam you've written about, too. Uh, but
starting with Christianity, I mean, the
thesis of your book essentially is that
Christianity is the soup we swim in, uh,
in in the Western world.
>> Yeah, it's the water. We're goldfish and
and Christianity is essentially the
water that we're swimming in.
>> Mh. And um talk to us because one of the
things I think very few people now
understand is how remarkable the
mentality shift that came with
Christianity was and how different
Christian civilization is to the
pre-Christian civilization in terms of
its values in terms of the things that
it thought were important in terms of
the things that it believed about you
know human beings and how they ought to
act and what they ought to value and so
on.
>> Yeah. I I I mean it is radically
different. Um but just to to um precage
what I'm going to say about that by
pointing out that obviously nothing
comes from nothing. Christianity emerges
from a particular matrix that you get in
first century AD Mediterranean. There
are all kinds of influences on it. Um
the the the Jewish most obviously but
also Greek Persian and the fact that it
is born into the Roman Empire. I I think
without the Roman Empire, it would not
have happened. Um, and on the topic of
the Roman Empire, I guess the the the
clearest demonstration of the the vibe
shift, if you want to call it that, is
to look at the the classic emblem of
Christianity, which is the cross. And
the cross is um for the Romans. Um it's
an expression of their right to torture
to death um anyone who opposes their
rule. Um it is the fate that is visited
um particularly paradomatically on
slaves
because it is the most agonizing but
also the most humiliating form of death
imaginable. Um you are stripped naked.
So, you know, if you think of pictures
of Christ on the cross, he usually has a
loin cloth. He wouldn't have had a loin
cloth. He would have, you know, it would
all have been exposed. Um, and you are
nailed or hung by ropes or suspended in
a wide variety of ways. There's no kinda
of set way of crucifying someone. Um,
and you are then a kinda public
spectacle. You're like a kinda
billboard advertising
um the power of the state that has put
you there. Um, and you can be, you know,
you can't ward the birds off as they
flock around your eyes and peck them
out. Um, you're constantly levering
yourself up and down to try and keep
your breath. Um, your suffering and your
agony is on absolutely public display
and perhaps when you die, you're left
there like a slab of meat. Um, so it is
an excruciating, agonizing, horrific
death. And
what Christianity does is to turn that
value system on its head and to say that
the person who's crucified triumphs over
the person who's crucified him. Um, and
the scale of that value shift,
I think, is illustrated by the way in
which in the early decades and centuries
of Christianity,
the fact that Jesus died on the cross
is a cause of deep
anxiety or at least embarrassment
to Christians who are talking about it.
So the earliest Christian writer that we
have the earliest evidence for
Christianity written evidence is um Paul
and in his letters he he situates the
death of Christ on the cross at the
center of what he is preaching but he is
also kinda embarrassed about it. And
so he says that um to uh to the the Jews
or the Judeans as I I'd rather cause
them um it's it's a stumbling block his
message but to everybody else to the to
the Greeks and and to the Romans it's
just madness. And the reason for that is
that what for for the Romans
what Paul is preaching um the idea that
a man can also be a god. I mean that's
that's that's not news because Julius
Caesar had become a god. Augustus is
worshiped as a god. That's not the
madness of it. The madness is the idea
that someone who had suffered this death
that paradatically is visited on slaves
is a god. That's the the lunacy of it.
And you sense that Paul is, you know,
constantly trying to preempt objections
to that that kinda position of
madness. And it's something that
continues throughout Christian writings
throughout the second century into the
3rd century. And even when Constantine
in the beginning of the 4th century uh
converts to Christianity and
Christianity starts to emerge as the you
know something that is first of all
permitted and then becomes um kinda
the the the state ideology there's still
a reluctance to illustrate Christ on the
cross and when you so there's um there's
an ivory casket in the British Museum
which illustrates various scenes from
the passion and you have Jesus on the
cross there. He looks unbelievably buff.
Um he's got he's got his loin cloth on
and it he he looks like um he looks well
he looks like an athlete. Um he looks
like someone who's winning first prize
in the Olympics. He looks like an
Instagram influencer.
>> He he looks Yeah, he looks like a
footballer. You know, he's kinda
toned. He's muscular. He's relaxed. He's
got this kinda completely mellow
expression on his face. He does not look
like someone who's worried about birds
coming and pecking out his eyeballs. Um,
and so even there you still don't have
the artist is reluctant to portray the
reality of crucifixion.
>> And it's not for another 500 years, not
until just before the first millennium
that you you get the first
representations of Christ dead on the
cross. And then over the course of the
middle ages, so the high middle ages, um
the the culture of Latin Christendom
becomes increasingly obsessed with the
sufferings of Christ. So it's portrayed
in art, but it's also in the liturgy,
it's in prayers, it's um it it dominates
the Christian imagination. And I think
that the long-term consequence of that
is that we as a civilization, people
growing up in in a world that's still
powerfully informed by Christianity, we
be being desensitized to what the cross
represents. You know, we see it as a
kinda abstract expression of
Christianity. We don't stop to think
that's you know, you know, people have
said, "Oh, it's like having, you know,
an electric chair as a symbol of your
faith or something of that." But but but
it is much much worse to be crucified
than to die in the electric chair.
>> Uh Tom, come back with me to what you
said earlier which I thought fascinating
because we talked about the moral
inversion, the flipping of morality
almost. And what we mean by this is
effectively in the in the in the
civilization in which Jesus was born and
lived. The idea was that you know it was
the strong conquer and win and the weak
suffer what they must or whatever that
phrase is effectively. Right? It's the
ideology that nature then kinda
reinstated later in the 20th century
which was this idea that you know the
strong must get what they want and the
weak are going to suffer and it's good
to be strong and it's bad to be weak.
And you say this was already there. It
came from something that was already
there in Roman society in the Greek
society in the Jewish traditions that
these people lived within. So how does
that how does that happen?
>> No, I'm not I'm not exactly saying that.
>> Okay. Correct. Um I'm saying that there
are if you think of Christianity as a a
great sea, there are many rivers that
flow into it.
>> So there's the the there's the um
obviously the kinda the Jewish
inheritance, the scriptural inheritance.
Um and with with from Greece, there is
the philosophical tradition. So the
influence of Aristotle and Plato on
Christianity as it evolves is absolutely
immense. Um there's a sense in which a
lot of theology is just kinda
footnotes to Plato like philosophy is.
Um uh the the the influence of Persia,
the Persians have this idea that that
that the universe is moralized that
there are rival principles of dark and
light of uh lies and truth. Um, and this
seems to be a big influence on on the
formation of Hebrew scripture because
people from Jerusalem are taken as
prisoners to Babylon and then Babylon
gets captured by the Persians and
they're allowed to go back and rebuild
the temple in Jerusalem and Cyrus the
the first great Persian king is hailed
in the Bible as a as a messiah as a kinda
of a liberator. Um, so that's also a
crucial part of it. And then what Rome
provides I think is is the notion of a
universal order. So the ideology of Rome
is that um they have imperium cine as
Birgil called it empire without limit.
The the the the the remit of Rome is
universal
>> and that is something that Christianity
kinda takes for granted that there is
a universal global order and Paul's
ability to you know write his letters to
the Galatians or the Ephesians or the
Corinthians or the Romans reflects that.
He the Mediterranean has become a a
Roman lake. The shipping lanes can be
used without fear of of pirates
attacking you. Um and roads are are
being built and you can travel on them.
The it's it's a globalized world. And so
that also is part of the kinda the
Christian context. The the idea that
someone who has suffered the death of a
slave could in some way be the universal
God who has created everything. that is
the radi you know that's the that's
what's novel that's what's radical
although having said that
I think when you look at Paul's letters
so the tradition of Paul as is embodied
in the acts of the apostles and Paul
talks about it himself in his letters is
that he was a persecutor of the church
he obviously thought the the Christian
notion that Jesus had risen from the
dead and was in some way a part of God
was powerfully offensive and then he has
a vision of the risen Christ he says
Um,
and
I think in the aftermath of that
experience, he goes away and he reads
through the scriptures to try and make
sense of what he has seen. And it's like
being given the it's like kinda um
being given the key to a detective story
where you go back and you you realize
that all kinds of things, you know,
you've been thrown off the scent. You've
missed what the actual solution to the
puzzle is. And I think that's the key
that Paul is bringing to Hebrew
scriptures. And he's realizing that all
the promises that that he had thought
were contained in scripture that that a
powerful warlord would come to redeem
God's people. But actually that wasn't
that wasn't what the key was. The key
was that the Messiah would come but he
would come as a man of sorrows. And so
he is drawing on the inheritance of
Hebrew scripture. It is there. But what
Christianity does is to kinda enshrine
it at the the molten heart of the gospel
um youangelon the good news that Paul is
is preaching.
>> I really like that we've talked about
the difference between the Christian god
and the gods that preceded it because if
you know anything about Roman gods or
Greek gods from which they were based on
they come across as petty vicious.
>> I think I think they come across as
unbelievably charismatic. really
>> I surely
>> well they the the
charismatic pettiness perhaps you might
say. You see I as a child um I went to
church and went to Sunday school and I
loved the Bible stories. I mean I
thought they were great but I was always
very much um on the side of the great
empires. So I was very much kinda team
Pharaoh as opposed to Moses and um love
the Assyrians, love the Babylonians, you
know, very much pro Pontious Pilot as
opposed to Jesus. And one of the reasons
for that was that I found the I found
their gods kinda more glamorous and
exciting. So everything that the Hebrew
prophets were condemning, you know, they
condemned the gods of Egypt or or or
Babylon as um so much stock and stone
that it's, you know, they're just great
idols and things. I I'd love an idol. I
thought that was much more kinda
glamorous than than what we got in the
church. Um, and specifically, I loved
the gods of Greece. I I found them so
much more charismatic. But you're right.
I mean, they're terrible. They're awful.
But in a way, a god like Athena seemed
to me to correspond much more closely to
how I felt the world was. You know,
she's very, very smart. Um, she's also
very violent. Um, she encourages all the
arts of civilization, but she's also
unbelievably petty, as you say. You
know, if you offend her, she will
inflict appalling things on you, but she
looks after her own. Um, and I I I kinda
always felt as a child that if Athena
had been a viable faith alternative, I
would absolutely have gone for her. Um
and I think the
the sense that the the the the
philosophers have so going back to the
sixth century um and then through to
Plato and Aristotle and to the um
particularly the Stoics um
that they are reacting as you do that
that Plato famously says we shouldn't
have poets in our ideal republic because
the the poets
make you feel the charisma of of of of
of these gods
>> and they are not worthy of of of being
followed or or worshiped and that the
true divine lies beyond these stories.
And essentially
it's that understanding of the divine
that Christian theologians then kinda
adopt and bundle into the the package.
I'd say you could in that sense say that
um
the Greek gods in a kinda weird way
are the malign stepparents of
Christianity that it's the rejection of
them. I mean in an edible way very
appropriate.
>> Um it's the the the the rejection of the
philosophers of that kinda quality of
the Greek gods is there. And it's
interesting I mean obviously this is
crucially a part of the context again
into which Christianity is born. So when
Paul has his vision of Christ according
to Acts, Christ says to him, Paul, why
are you kicking against the pricks,
>> you know, why are you why why are you
kicking against what I'm giving you? And
this is a phrase that comes from
Uripides great play, the back eye, which
describes Dionis appearing and there are
people who reject him um and the fate
that is visited on them is is terrible.
say Pentheus, the king of thieves, who
is Dianisis's cousin, refuses to
recognize his cousin as a god. I mean,
as he would if he cousin turns up and
says he's gone, not going to have
anything to do with. And um he suffers a
terrible fate. He um you know, his his
aunts go mad uh roam the countryside um
tearing cattle to pieces and throwing
bits of flesh all over the trees and
things. Um Penthus is tries to arrest
them. Uh Dionis drives him mad. He
dresses up as a manad as a literally a
raver. um someone who goes to a rave. So
he dresses up in whatever you know the
main ads are are wearing kinda um
animal skins. He goes up to try and and
spy on his mother and his aunts and they
see him and rip him to pieces as though,
you know, as though he's a wild animal.
Um this is obviously not what Christ is
doing to Paul. But
there are clearly
um resemblances between a god say like
Dianisis and Christ that even Paul can
recognize. How often do you get the

>> It's such a good point you made because
when I was reading your book and I was
going over Greek and Roman history with
the gods, the one word that stood out to
me was cruelty. It was viciously they're
viciously cruel. Take the story of
Prometheus
gave fire to the to the human beings
doomed to have I think it was an eagle
rip out his heart every day his liver
there his liver his liver to be ripped
out but then you contrast that
>> he grows back every day and then the
eagle comes back and rips it out.
>> Yeah. Yeah. you know, he he liked to die
of awful. Anyway, but you had like Jesus
who when he was dying said to God whilst
he was suffering the most horrendous of
and brutal of fates on the cross,
"Forgive them Lord for they know not
what they do." That is a radical
transformation, isn't it? It's a radical
difference.
>> Yes, it's very radical. And you
mentioned nature. I mean, this is what
nature fixes on. Um I I mean I said how
we've become desensitized to the cross.
I I think it's amazing that nature who
is is the most
brilliant of all atheist writers who
have emerged in in in the west.
He gets the cross. He gets what is
radical and subversive about the cross
>> to a degree that theologians haven't
really articulated for for centuries and
centuries. uh you know there is
something of Paul's bewilderment and
perplexity and shock contemplating the
death of Christ on the cross about about
nature and he he finds it repellent
because he thinks that um
what he famously calls Christianity a
slave religion that it's a religion for
the weak and the and and the poor and
that um its popularity is driven by the
resort the the the not quite resentment
the the kinda mingling of resentment
and hostility that those who are weak
feel for the strong. Um, and nature
thinks that
the strong
are healthy and that healthiness should
be celebrated and that if strength
involves um strapping up someone who has
annoyed you to a rock and sending an e
eagle to devour his his liver every day,
well, brilliant. Bring it on. you know,
let's crack on.
>> But there's but there's another aspect
of Christianity which is very powerful
where Constantine and I uh went to
Sicily and we did a guided tour of these
Greek temples and Roman temples. And one
of the things the guide said to us was
this was a place the temple was a place
for the high priests. This was a place
for the upper echelons of religious
society. Whereas the church is a place
for everybody. Well, I I I'm not sure
that's entirely true. the
the temples and the shrines say in
Greece or Rome
>> particular let's look at Athens the
democracy in Athens
>> the the the temples are seen as
and the rituals and the rights that are
practiced to keep Athena and the other
gods happy
are fundamental to the health of the
entire demos the entire people
and
unless you buy into that you don't
understand what makes a city like
democratic Athens tick.
>> Um
so the the the power the cratia of the
demos we translate it as as people power
and we think of it as as democracy and
but democracy in English is is a kinda
it's a it's a false friend. It's it it
doesn't mean what it meant for for for
Athens. We tend to think democracy is
founded on rights. People have a right
to a vote. So um therefore the fact that
men in Athens had a vote and uh women
didn't is offensive to us.
This is not how it operated in Athens
because the role of the men and women,
all those who have sprung from the soil
of Atica are part of a continuum that
reaches back into the past, forward into
the future and is in a in a kinda
relationship with the gods. So the soil,
the people, the gods. This is a kinda
in it's an ecosystem in which every all
everyone flourishes and everyone has
their role and the role of men in this
ecosystem is to keep the demos secure
the deemos against external enemies. So
to go out and fight against rival cities
and also to draw up the laws that will
enable the city to prosper in in the
that the the the kinda the dimension
of the mortal.
But just as important or possibly even
more important is the role of keeping
the gods on side. And in that women have
a very very important role.
>> Um they provide uh they they weave the
robes that every year is given to one of
the two statues on the Acropolis. So, so
every fourth year there's an enormous
one that goes to the statue of Athena in
um in in the in the Pathonon and and
every year a slightly smaller one to the
kinda the ancient wooden statue of the
goddess. They feed the the holy snakes
on the Acropolis with cakes. Um they
practice cults. So they uh where in the
great festival of Dionis they um they
welcome Dianisis in and um women go to a
a temple in the marshes to Dionis and
there one of them has sex with the um
with the the a king and nobody really
knows what this involves but I mean it's
clearly something's going on there and
and the the thing I love is that every
young girl in Athens when she becomes 10
goes to this temple of Artemis who like
Athena is a kinda terrifying goddess,
virgin goddess, um, mistress of the
beasts she's called. And girls go out
there um, and we're told in the the
classical sources that there they turn
into bears. And scholars debate what
what does this mean? I mean, does it is
it a puberty ritual? You know, do they
put on the robes of, you know, the skins
of bears or what? Nobody pauses to
think, well, maybe they did turn into
bears. But what if they did turn into
bears? What if they did? They are then
roaming with Artemis out in the wilds.
um they have experienced things that men
have not experienced and every man who
marries a woman in Athens is marrying
someone who's run with Artemis, who's
run with the animals and I think people
believed that and it gives a shiver of
of the supernatural and the weird to the
functioning of of Athens in its golden
age that we find very difficult to get a
handle on because of course the
instincts of historians are incredibly
materialist and even if they do believe
in in in the supernatural, they don't
believe in the Greek gods. But you've
got to try and believe in them. And when
you do, you see that
it's part of the rhythm and the fabric
of the functioning of the entire city.
And this is why in the long run the
philosophers are so threatening to that
because if you're turning around and
saying that's all rubbish,
God is is kinda perfection in some
distant moral order or something. What
role is there then for for girls going
off and turning into bears and running
with with with Artemis?
>> Well, look, I'm no historian, but I'm
I'm fairly comfortable with the idea of
women turning into bears every now and
again. Uh that that is a familiar
experience. Um but I I was going to come
back to Christianity because one of the
things that I wanted to ask you about is
um
[Music]
my personal experience I was surrounded
by a lot of Orthodox Christians when I
was growing up my family orthodox
Christians and uh one of the things I
found quite inongruous was that uh there
was a doctrine of what you're supposed
to do and then I'd observe people who
>> orthodoxy
>> there was an orthodoxy uh that nobody
actually did any of those things they
just talked about them And one of the
interesting things to me about
Christianity is I imagine you know my
Anglican friends let's say who are kinda
very peaceful and dosile almost you
might say and very kind and generous
etc. That is not the way that
Christianity has been practiced through
the centuries uh in some parts of the
world. So how and how you know the
message of Jesus turning the other cheek
and all these other things that is not
also the way that Christianity has been
practiced throughout the ages either.
There's been quite militant periods.
There's been periods of internal
persecution of you know all sorts of
recrimination between different branches
etc. How how does how does all of that
happen?
Um,
Christianity
I think is best thought of as um
a kinda great pulsing matrix of
paradoxes.
Paradox
structures everything about it. I mean,
you know, we've been talking about one
the the the the guy on the cross who
proves to be greater than the person
who's crucified him. um the man who is
also a god. Um and
I guess that this is the kinda the
Christian understanding of the divine
that that in a sense paradox structures
the inability of of the human mind to
contemplate
>> the potency of of the divine. And that
being so um there are many many
different ways of of structuring and
understanding
what it is to be a Christian. And a lot
of these are generated by the fact that
um you know and it's a crucial
development that might not have happened
that in the second century um there's a
guy called Marian who
makes points out that
the God of the New Testament seems quite
different to the God of the Old
Testament. the Old Testament has the Old
Testament, you know, he's all he's busy
sm, you know, King David holds a census
and God goes ballistic and kinda wipes
all the children of Israel out with a
plague.
>> You know, there's a lot of smiting and
that kinda thing going on.
>> And now suddenly Jesus is say, "Oh, you
know, turn the other cheek and put up
your sword and and what's going on
here?" And so he Marian's theory was
that um
that the god of the Old Testament was a
different essentially a kinda
subordinate angel who had usurped the
true God's um role and that Jesus had
therefore been sent by the true God to
kinda put humanity back on the
straight and narrow.
>> And he he he proposed that uh
there should be a very finite number of
of of scriptures. So the gospel of Luke,
Acts of the Apostles, some of the
letters of Paul basically. And this is a
a a key moment because
I think you can already by this point
talk about Orthodox Christians,
Christians who embody the kinda the
mainstream of or the at least the kinda
the central gravity in the church.
They do not follow that. But they but
but because of this challenge, they have
to decide what is you know what what is
the cannon going to be? What are what
are our scriptures going to be?
and they they choose the four gospels
because these are the ones that are the
most closest to the time. They're the
ones that that are generally accepted as
being the most authentic record and you
know the various letters of Paul and the
book of Revelation and so on. And they
also decide to keep what they they come
to term the Old Testament and the sense
that God had prefigured the coming of
Christ in the Hebrew scriptures. And by
doing that, it
it sets up opportunities for Christians
to
emphasize
things that perhaps aren't being
emphasized in the passion narratives.
Let's put it like that.
>> Well, what what I'm getting at, Tom, is
uh let me put it more bluntly. You know,
you're very eloquent and a historian.
I'm just what I'm saying is in my
understanding
>> why have Christians behaved in monstrous
way throughout history
>> for example I guess what I'm saying is
my experience of Christians today is
that if somebody stood up and went you
know what these people are heretics and
they must be eradicated most Christians
would be like that's a bit much do you
know what I mean
>> well that's been a long process of
weathering and and transformation and
the thing is that Christianity isn't a
you know it's a constantly I mean it's
best thought of I think as a kinda
civilization
>> you would you know things evolve and
change and different emphases are
happening all the time
>> this is why I'm asking because when you
talk to Christians today they will say
say compare it to Islam right if you say
well Islam is not as drastic today as it
was when it was first created probably
true and process of weathering is
perfect explanation to my layman
understanding you'll probably rip into
this right but with Christianity there
was the message of compassion and
empathy and turning the other cheek and
and all of that from the beginning. So
what is it that's being weathered over
this
>> well? Okay, so go back to the the issue
of paradox
>> um Paul in his letters writing to the
Galatians. So this is really re I mean
might even be among the earliest of
letters. So right at the start of the
Christian tradition he writes to them
and he says that that in Christ there is
no Jew or Greek, there is no man or
woman, there is no slave or free. So
he's dissolving the traditional
boundaries that are separated, you know,
the two sexes, the different peoples of
the world and the different social
orders.
>> It's very progressive.
>> Well, he's saying in Christ Jesus.
>> I mean, he's not
>> the world the world is fallen. These
differences and the what stems from
these differences are are part of the
lot of the children of Adam and Eve. You
know, we've all we're all part of this
fallen world. I mean, that's the gist.
But that in Christ they will be
dissolved. This is the the heaven that
is promised.
>> Mhm.
>> Um now
of course there is it's like an acorn
from which a great oak will flourish.
And I would say that the the um the
assumptions that govern a a a liberal
society derive from that. the idea that
men and women have an inherent
equality that um differences between
peoples are you know are iniquitous to
emphasize um I mean you know we'll come
to slavery perhaps in due course but the
idea that um there should be uh
I mean you can see that there is no no
slave or free it feeds in the long run
into abolitionism it feeds into French
revolution to the Russian revolution I
mean these are very very long-term
consequences. I mean, another metaphor,
I love mixing up the metaphors, would be
that is, you know, that is a a grumbling
of the earth, a grinding of the tectonic
plates, and in due course, Tokyo gets
drowned by a tsunami. It's that kinda
that's that that's what it is. But right
from the beginning, there is a problem
with one of those in particular, which
is Paul's assertion that there is no Jew
or Greek. He he writes what he means is
Judeian or Greek. He is a Judeian. He's
from Judea. He is therefore a provincial
like any other. You know there are all
kinds of people Judeans, Egyptians,
whatever. And he's comparing them to to
the Greeks. And he's saying that the the
differences between Judeans and Greeks
will dissolve in Christ. I.E. there will
be a kinda universal brotherhood,
sisterhood, whatever. Mhm.
>> However, famously, not all Judeans are
keen on having their sense of
distinctiveness dissolved into a kinda
universal mush. And so, they do not in
the main follow Paul's exaltation to
accept Christ as Lord.
And that then means that there is a
fracture point right from the beginning
between people who will come to be
defined as Christians and Jews. And that
is obviously an incredibly dark shadow
that has hung over the entire course of
Christianity. But you can see how what
seems to us a progressive message has
kinda led to what we could also see as
very dark consequences. And that is just
one verse from one book of the New
Testament which in turn is part of you
know includes the Old Testament. There
is a lot of material there that can
provide sanction for a broad broad array
of responses and that can also set in
train all kinds of trends that
you know would would have seemed
unimaginable in the first century AD.
>> Tom is that why so everyone can drink.
So my mother's Venezuelan and it's
really fascinating to see the way that
the Spanish concquchistadors behaved in
South America and the Portuguese
Empire behaved in South America and they
come from a Catholic tradition to the
way that the British Empire behaved. Was
that a large part of the way they
behaved based on religion or was there
something else to it?
Well, the the the Spanish are the first
to discover great powers in a world that
no one had imagined before. Um, and so
when they
when they conquer the Aztec Empire and
then the the Incor Empire, they I mean,
I don't know if you played um a game
like Civilization. I played colonization
which
civiliz civilization
civilization you could end up with um
tanks attacking archers.
>> Yes.
>> And that's basically what you have
because the Aztecs is kinda bronze age
civilization. I mean, beautiful,
fascinating, extraordinary, but but
collapses before everything that the
Spanish bring because they're the the
the kinda beneficiaries of
>> thousands of years of Eurasian, you
know, crops and cattle and all kinds of
things like that.
>> Um, and this in obviously the Spanish
interpret this as as an expression of of
kinda
God's
plan. Mhm.
>> They're bringing Christ to to to people
who had previously walked in darkness.

now back to the show.
Sorry to interject very briefly. How
much of it was that were they genuinely
seeking to expand in the new world for
religious reasons or was there a lot of
pragmatism to it? You know,
>> obviously it varies. Um I mean the the
concistadors are unbelievably brutal in
the main and if they hadn't been brutal
then they wouldn't have done what they
did. You know they wouldn't have
conquered what they what they ended up
conquering. they the the the lust for
gold becomes notorious. Um it is
absolutely about wanting material goods.
But to imagine that um the uh
the desire to win souls for Christ is
simply cynical window dressing is a very
you know that's a very inacronistic
take. There are absolutely people who
are going out there who who feel that
this is a you know this is absolutely
part of God's plan and
there are
there are friars of of whom the most
famous is a guy called Balme de Lascas
who condemns
the oppression and the greed of the
concistadors as an offense against God.
Um, and
there is a great kinda scholarly
debate in Spain between those who are
drawing on Greek philosophers,
particularly Aristotle
>> to essentially, you know, the the strong
do what they will, the weak must suck it
up kinda argument that there are those
who are destined for to be slaves and
there are those who are destined to be
masters. And they're drawing on on on
Greek philosophy for that. And then
there is Lascaz who's saying no, he's
drawing on the gospels. He's saying, you
know, slavery is is an evil. Um, these
are these are people who who who are as
worthy of respect as any other anyone
else who has been one for Christ. They
must be one for Christ. And you can see
there the beginnings of kinda ideas
that will feed ultimately into kinda
notions of of international law. Um,
and that's a Catholic perspective.
The British obviously are uh Protestant
um and therefore they bring a slightly
different perspective. One perspective
is is that the Spanish are evil.
So so the what they call the black
legend, the idea that um the Spanish are
uniquely appalling. Um which is often
they're drawing on Lascaz and other
>> Spanish writers like him to to kinda
condemn the Spanish. I mean, it's it's
it's very much kinda Protestant black
propaganda, I think. But the British
have their own route to deciding that
slavery is is wrong. Um, it's as
Christian as this as as the Spanish one,
but it's it's um it's distinctively
Protestant. And
what you have with the kinda radical
form of Protestantism that develops in
England um in the Civil War and then the
Commonwealth and its aftermath is is
this notion that the spirit descends on
you and enables you to read scripture in
the way that it's meant to be properly
understood. So the simple words on the
page, you know, this is inadequate to
properly understand it. You have to have
the spirit. You have to have been
granted grace by the spirit by by by
God.
>> And when you do that, then you can see
what it properly means. And this
revolution
um in England is trans is transported to
the Caribbean and it's transported to um
the American colonies. And so Quakers
are the most obvious example, but um
Baptists and and people like that. And
this coincides with the development of
plantation slavery in the Caribbean and
in in um the American colonies. And
this
Britain is starting to industrialize by
this point. And industrialization is
about
utilizing resources
in a way that is more intensive than has
ever been done before. And what that
means for slaves is obviously horrendous
because you industrialize the process of
of transporting slaves, of exploiting
them, of of working them.
So you have the conjunction of that, the
industrialization of slavery and the um
this radical notion that um you can only
understand God's purpose by reading the
the the scriptures with a sense of the
spirit. And it it it combines
to inspiring Quakers and evangelical
Anglicans um a sense that slavery is
wrong. Even though famously, notoriously
even there nowhere in the Bible does it
say that slavery is wrong. Slavery is
taken for granted in the Bible because
it's it's seen as you know the way the
fact the hunger is or poverty or
homelessness or whatever. It's just part
of the human condition. But radical
Protestants in the 18th century and then
into the early 19th century are saying
no actually it may not say this but but
I I feel the spirit is telling me
slavery is wrong and it spreads like a
wildfire and the spirit is
conceptualized by Christians as fire
Pentecostal fire. So it's literally kinda
of Pentecostal fire blazing across the
Atlantic in Britain, in the Caribbean,
in the the North American colonies,
particularly in the northern colonies.
And it inspires the first great activist
movement in Britain. You have people
writing to their MPs. You have
demonstrations going through the streets
of London demanding the abolition of
slavery. And it becomes um so
unignorable for the government that in
1814 Napoleon has been defeated and sent
off to Ela. This is Congress in Vienna
to draw redraw the map of of um Europe.
And Lord Castle, the foreign secretary
has to go to Vienna and basically says,
"Guys, I'm really sorry, but I've got
all these all these guys who are, you
know, people in London who are holding
street demonstrations and things. We've
got to sort this out. We've got to
abolish the slave trade." Um and this
carries on even you know through
Waterloo and and and the second defeat
of Napoleon and
the Protestant tradition that Castle Ray
is representing is obviously means
nothing to the Catholic powers to the
French to the Spanish to the Portuguese.
So they they draw on those traditions
that Lascaz have been articulating. Um
so Catholic traditions and it gets bl bl
bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl
bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl
bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl
blended with the protestant traditions
and so also do the radical traditions of
the of the revolution the French
revolution kinda the the the
radicalism of that because because the
the French revolution had abolished
slavery um in in the Caribbean and then
Napoleon had brought it back in. So
there are the so essentially it's a
pooling of these three traditions all of
which are bred of the marrow of of of
Christian Europe. the the Protestant,
the Catholic and the kinda the
enlightenment tradition if you want to
call it that. And
this is what gives birth essentially to
international the concept of
international law. The idea that there
are principles that transcend religious
doctrine so that a Protestant and a
Catholic can equally accept the dictates
of international law. And this is what
enables British ships when they are
patrolling the Atlantic that that gives
them the legal right to stop Portuguese
or Spanish slave ships and arrest those
who are doing it and say put them on
coast of Cuba and try them under
international law. And it's also
provides a rubric for what then happens
in the 19th century when the British
start to go on the attack against the
Muslim slave trade because of course
Muslims have very different sanctions
for slavery. And so
the process by which Muslim powers come
to accept that slavery is an evil kinda
requires them to accept the primacy
of international law which is a massive
massive deal for Muslims because they
have a framework of law that derives
supposedly from God. So it's much
trickier for them than it is for
Christians because Christians don't have
that notion of a God-given corpus of
laws that have come from God. But
essentially that is the framework of
international law that governs you know
upholds notions of human rights and so
on to this day. Tom when you were
talking about the fact that it was a
religious movement that spread like
wildfire that helped to eradicate well
for the British Empire to stop using
slaves and to eradicate slavery in the
empire. It made me think, and I'm only
going to touch it on it briefly, with
the way that the woke movement talked
about slavery and how we were the
beneficiary of slavery, which to a
certain extent we are, but it it it the
way they talked about it was in the form
of original sin. Yes,
>> we are born into this sin and we are
never going to be washed clean and it is
an indenible stain on our reputation and
fundamentally our souls as well.
>> Well, I so I think what what happens is
that um
slavery comes to be seen as as as the
the great sin. M
>> I mean it's it's clearly a monstrous
appalling crime
but we judge that by Christian
standards. We accept it as an appalling
crime because we have bought into the
assumptions of Lascas or the Quakers or
whatever. It it it's
if you look at the entirety of of global
history, it's not in any way a moral
given. Um civilizations have dep always
depended upon the exploitation of the
masses. And that could be chattal
slavery of the kinda that you have in
Greece and Rome and then in the the um
the Atlantic in in the 18th century. Or
it could be founded on cast, the idea
that certain people are born to be
inferior. Um or it could be upon the
exploitation of you know proletariats
which you get in 19th century industrial
civilization. who always
you know there is no form of
civilization that does not is not also a
reflection of barbarism is the is the
the kinda the famous quotation I'm
paraphrasing I can't remember it exactly
the Walter Benjamin comment so there's
always been exploitation the idea that
that that slavery is therefore um not
just an unfortunate corollery of the way
of things but a a a moral stain that has
to be eradicated Ed is very very novel
and because it's
because it happened um
in a uniquely horrible form in the
Atlantic and because it was Christians
who who drove that to a degree it
contaminated I think the kinda
Christian record in the eyes of of of
people who were themselves absolutely
saturated with Christian assump
assumptions and it kinda bled into um
anti-imperialism
moving into the the 20th century. Again,
the idea that the the powerful countries
shouldn't dominate weaker countries. I
mean, most
the history of of of of the world is
basically the record of empires, the
idea that empires are problematic to
use, you know, favorite phrase of of the
woke is again a relatively recent one.
Um and it's meant that that Christianity
which is a universal religion it it it
Christians believe that it's for the
good of the world that everyone becomes
a Christian. Um there are more
Christians practice you know more
Christians than any other kinda
practicing ideology in the in the world
that has come to be seen by lots of
people as itself
evil.
the the kinda the the evangelical
impetus of Christianity is seen as you
know going out and and and and
you know overthrowing the right of the
Aztecs to do what they want even if that
is um human sacrifice
>> um or you know whatever.
And so the consequence of that is that
today
we remain the heirs of these Christian
impulses, the notion that slavery is is
an evil. Um
but Christianity has been implicated in
that. And so therefore the
the institutional character of
Christianity is is is often rejected as
part of the problem of part of what has
to be rejected even though it is that
institutional structure that has
provided people with the ideological
framework that enables them to judge it
as evil. And so I think what you saw in
um in 2020 and its aftermath was a
deeply Christian movement. I mean
something that the Quakers in the 18th
century would have recognized. Um the
kinda the line of descent from the
activism of Quakers in the 18th century
is very very clear. That's what they're
doing. But because they have jettisoned
the Christian scripture, the Christian
practice, the Christian
self-identification that had provided
structure for the Quakers and the early
activists, they essentially have to
construct
their own traditions. And so that's why
you had all the um the toppling of
statues, which is kinda very
Protestant thing to do, toppling idols,
um taking the knee, um uh people um you
know, offering themselves up for as
penitentials, white people. Um
>> it it's it's very very these are very
very Christian forms of practice. It's
just that they have been divorced from
the the institutional framework that
gave them birth. And so where they where
they how and where they're developing is
unclear. And I think that they are
clearly mutating very fast because once
you you unore ideas and stories and
traditions from the the context that
gave them birth, they can mutate very
very quickly. It's very interesting you
mentioned that because we we had a super
viral very popular interview we did with
a journalist called Richard Min in which
we talked about some of the ideas from
Albian Seed the idea of how the United
States became what it became. And one of
the things he explained to us I think
this may have been off camera was how
many of these work ideas originate from
the very areas of America where the
Quakers would have once settled. Very
interesting. But moving on Tom, one of
the other great religions that I think
we are incredibly uneducated about. And
I speak for myself above anyone else
here in the Western world particularly
is Islam. And it's becoming a bigger
conversation politically and society
because of immigration policy because
the number of Muslim followers is
followers of Islam in the Western world
is growing. Um, and I'd love to know
more about how that religion came into
being. What are its core values? What
are its principles? You mentioned some
of them already, but can you expand on
Could I could I could I just before
before I do that just put Islam in the
context of the the kinda the Christian
story of course as manifested in in in
the present west because I think that's
important to understand why there are
tensions between Islam and western
secular liberalism and why there is such
a reluctance to acknowledge this on the
part of of um enthusiasts for secular
liberalism because essentially what
Christianity
has that Islam does not is a concept of
the secular.
And this is goes right the way back to
to um ultimately I mean you can trace it
to the story of of um Jesus being asked
whether taxes should be paid to Caesar.
You know he's famously asked for a coin
and there's the picture of Caesar and he
says whose head is this and he says
render unto Caesar what is Caesars?
Render unto God what is gods. And so so
that sense that there is um
>> you're talking about the separation of
what the Americans call church and state
>> and they and and we call it here church
and state. You know the notion of church
and state there isn't synagogue and
state. There isn't mosque and state.
It's church and state. And and in the
west that's because it this notion of
there being two rival orders gets
enshrined by the towering theological
genius in the Latin church. Augustine um
great in in North Africa in the late
fourth early fifth century um AD and
this is against the backdrop of the
collapse of Roman power Rome has been
sacked and there are Romans who say this
is because we have rejected the old
order the old customs that enabled us to
keep the gods on sight. So you know
going back to that stuff I was saying
about Athens these rituals these
festivals are are like kinda insurance
payments to keep the gods happy. uh and
now we've abandoned these. And the
Romans called these religiones. So a you
know a sacrifice or a festival in honor
of a god is a religio. It's a bond that
joins you to um to to to a god and is a
kinda guarantee that this god will
then look after the after the city. And
these religion have been abandoned. And
Augustine says no not a bit of it. Um,
and the reason for that is that
everything in the fallen world is bound
upon what he calls the cyclulum, which
is basically the span of human life. But
it means the notion that everything is
is doomed to to to to pass away. All
things must pass as George Harrison will
put it.
>> Um, and
he says that this is true of of empires
as well as of individuals. Rome is not
permanent. Rome has no special
significance. It will pass away. It is
bound upon the cyclulum. If you want
eternity, you must
you you must bind yourself to the pure
eternity of heaven. That's what the the
real religio is. And it's only the
church that can give you this religio.
So there you have the you know as the
Roman Empire falls this notion of of
there being an order of the cyclulum,
the order of religio. And over the
course of of medieval history, this
becomes institutionalized
and it going into the kinda the
reformation and into modernity, it
mutates to become this idea that there
is this space called the secular which
is kinda neutral. It's separated from
what has come to be called religion. And
this is a mad idea. No other culture has
ever had this idea.
So, so when you read about, you know,
ancient Greek religion,
they did they had no concept of religion
and they certainly had no concept of
religion as being something that is
separate from the kinda the the
everything else. It's, you know, the the
relationship of people to the gods is
like the the gin in a tonic. You can't
separate out the gin and the tonic. What
what what Christianity does
is to say, "Yeah, you can have gin and
here's the tonic and you can separate
them out." That's that's the madness of
of the way that we conceptualize the
world in the west and Islam has no
concept that you can separate this out.
And so this means therefore
>> that what we have in the west is an idea
that you have freedom of religion and
Jews in the 19th century had freedom of
religion in the wake of the the French
Revolution. They are told you know you
can you can practice your religion as
you want. Jews didn't have religion.
They they were a people, but they're
being told if you want to become the
citizens of the French Republic, that's
that's brilliant, but you can no longer
define yourself as a citizen of of of
Israel. You know, you are now a French
citizen who practices what comes to be
called Judaism as a religion.
>> Mhm.
>> And so, Jews in the 19th and in the 20th
century have to adapt the, you know,
their traditions to fit this very
specific modern western secular
template. and and
western secular democracies require
Muslims to do the same to to to
conceptualize what they belong to as
being a religion. But classically,
that's not how Muslims understood it.
Islam is a a totalizing way of leading
your life. There are there are rules
that govern every aspect of your
existence. God is manifested in
everything that you do. The idea that
there are kinda safe spaces where
everyone can meet up and kinda join in
a in a secular space is something
completely alien. And I don't think that
most
most kinda enthusiasts for liberal
secularism understand this. They tend to
I think they they think that the notion
of the secular is something that is
common to everybody. That it's kinda
like, you know, everyone has a sense of
what a tree is. Everyone has a sense of
what a dog is. um everyone has a sense
of what the secular is. They don't. And
so Muslims are being forced in when they
come to the west are being forced into
this kinda procrustian bed of the
secular notion of what a religion is.
>> The only reason I keep trying to
interject is I'm trying always to
convert what you're saying into simpler,
more easier to understand language. And
I guess what you're saying is the
central tension there is theologically
speaking
Islam doesn't allow the separation of
politics and Islam. If you are a Muslim
well classically that's why I said
theologically speaking there are of
course individual people who are able to
do so but within the way that the
religion is
um if you follow that faith then that
faith controls everything. It controls
the way you participate in society, the
way you live your life and the way you
you might vote in a in a society. Your
your loyalty will be to that above other
things. Is that fair summation?
>> Well, ought to be according to the
>> trend.
>> All right, people. It's trivia time.
Financial trivia to be exact. Do you
know what retirement asset grew the most
in the first 6 months of President
Trump's second term? Many of you
probably guessed the stock market was
the best since what's backing the most
retirement accounts in American today is
that. But from January the 21st through
July 21st, the Dow Jones grew less than
1%. What about Bitcoin? President Trump
loves Bitcoin, so it must have performed
well, right? Well, it did. It grew
nearly 15%, an impressive 6-month
investment, but it's not the number one.
The heavyweight champion was, wait for
it, gold and silver. Gold and silver are
considered to be safe haven investments.
So many of you will be surprised to
learn they both grew by a whopping 25%
in President Trump's first 6 months. 25%
in 6 months. Not bad for safe haven
investments. Our partners Augusta

Muhammad is a seal of the prophets. He
has brought God's last message. And the
Quran is a record of um humanity's
disobedience to prophets. Prophets
arrive, they reveal God's wishes, they
then ignore it or they corrupt God's
message or whatever. And so more
prophets have to come. Muhammad is the
last prophet. He and and what he teaches
mankind is mankind's last hope. If if
Islam goes then mankind is doomed.
Everyone will go to hell. So it's
absolutely you know existential stakes.
And
the proof that um that Islam is true
again classically is that Islam is
triumphant for most of its existence. I
mean it pulverizes um the Cisanian
Empire. it dismembers the Roman Empire,
conquers vast sways of the Christian
world, the kinda ancient Christian
heartlands of Mediterranean
Christianity. Um, and it's really only
with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in the
at the very end of the 18th century that
Muslim powers are suddenly brought up
against the fact that the the the
despised Christian powers are incredibly
powerful. And over the course of the
19th into the 20th century, most Muslim
powers come under either the direct or
the indirect hegman of Christian western
powers. And so that's a massive massive
shock and it requires a recalibration of
what of what Islam is. I mean the the
the um the attitude to slavery would be
a classic example. The reason that the
Sultan in Constantinople is willing to
contemplate banning the slave trade even
though it had been legitimized by the
fact that Muhammad had slaves and that
the the early caiffs in you know they
were all in favor of slavery. They
thought it was brilliant. Um and that
that it's mandated in in Islamic
scriptures. Um the only reason he was
willing to do that was that he needed
the help of the British and the French
in the Crimean War against the Russians.
And so he essentially kinda employed
his top his top scholars to try and work
out a way in which you know this this
this you know Islamic law could be
squared with this radical new new
notion. And this has been part of the
kinda the great trauma for Muslims in
in the modern world is how do you adapt
it? And essentially what what Muslims
did
was to kinda protestantize themselves.
So they slightly adopted the sense that
you know it's in the heart you you know
it may say this in the Quran go out and
crucify people who are offenders against
God but what that actually means is that
you should try and be kind to them. I
mean it's it's that's the kinda you
know it's the
>> so this is the people who say jihad is
the internal
>> jihad is yeah which it kind I mean that
that that that is a part of it but it's
not
>> the entirety of it
>> it absolutely is not part of it but yes
absolutely um
and so you have you have the the
you know you look at your heart and
therefore you can adjust and adapt the
legacy of Islamic um scripture
for the modern world. You know, get on
the right side of history, all these
kinda very Protestant ideas or uh the
the counter reaction to that is again a
very Protestant one, which is to go
fundamentalist because in in in 20th
century Protestantism, you have
Protestants who were you know faced with
Darwin and all this kinda stuff and
they say we've got to go back and
interpret the scriptures literally.
>> Um which neither Christians or Muslims
had ever really done. um they had you
know they have a very very sophisticated
complicated almost poetic understanding
of of the scriptures but but
fundamentalist Protestants were saying
well what does the Bible say it's
inherent that's what we're going to do
and so Muslims also have have adopted
that policy and the consequence of that
has been a kinda very brutal
understanding of Islam because there's
quite a lot in the Quran and in the um
the hadiths and in the life of Muhammad
that if interpreted in a kinda
brutally literal way sanctions quite a
lot of bloodshed
>> and so that's that's you know part of
the problem. Well, quite and and this is
this this is so informative, Tom. I'm so
glad we're talking about this because I
I'm really keen to understand this from
a deep perspective. And one of the
things that I wanted to ask you about in
this context is how is it is there a
unique challenge for Islam to you call
it Protestantize itself, which is to to
start to develop an interpretation
that's more compatible with modern
reality
>> for a number of reasons. One of them
being the Quran is the literal word of
God and the last word of God. This is
the kinda the problem. You can't have
a reformation if this is
>> this is it, right? Like you you can't
challenge any of that.
>> I think Islam is uniquely indigestible
for a a secular mindset. Um and people
don't want to admit that in a way
because um
>> there's a default assumption that
secular civilization can swallow
anything up.
>> There's a kinda arrogance there that
secular civilization of the secular
civilization of the west is such a broad
tent that everyone can be brought into
it. But Islam is at least as
sophisticated
um
a civilization as as the civilization of
the Christian West
>> um and a very ancient one. Uh and for
most of its existence has been much much
more powerful than the Christian world.
And therefore the idea that that it
should accommodate itself to what
liberal secularists think it should do
isn't a given. So Muslims in in say in a
country like Britain have freedom of
religion.
But there are lots of Muslims who do not
see Islam as a religion because they see
religion as a Christian category. Islam
is much more than a religion. It's
something that saturates every aspect of
existence and therefore they don't
necessarily want that. They want to they
want to live in a a world where um you
know as as has traditionally been the
case. Islam is everywhere. But that is
obviously something that the liberal
state is not prepared to offer. So there
are limits to what secularism and
liberalism can and will offer. So
where's what's the obvious question is
and I mean it's probably unfair question
to ask a historian but we where is this
going? I don't know. I'm not I'm not a
prophet unlike Muhammad. Um
I mean my my guess is that that um that
that Islam rather in the way that um
Judaism has done will accommodate itself
to
to to the the host society. I mean
that's traditionally what happens but
that there will always be kickback
because of what makes Islam distinctive.
And also obviously the more Muslims
there are the more weight their voices
will have and so the more under pressure
the the kinda the the secular
assumptions of the west will come and I
don't quite know I I don't know where
that go because I mean I mean the worry
for a lot of people is it's not
necessarily Islam it's that kinda very
hard extremist edge of Islam that we see
in in this country and if you go will
will that remain will it ever be
weathered will I mean these are
impossible questions to ask because I I
think that's a worry for a lot of people
Tom is that I think it is
>> and if there's no reformation possible
then is this just a continuation
>> well I I I mean I think Islam in to a
degree has had a reformation because the
reformation is all about going to back
to to to scripture and and getting rid
of the kinda accretion of of what's
seen as superstition
and Islam has repeatedly been doing
that. It's it's a constant kinda
summons to to
>> to reform Islam. And so certainly, you
know, the ideologues of the Islamic
State would say that they were
reformers. Um that's why they they for
instance um completely dismiss any
notion of international law. It's why
they dismiss notions of human rights.
It's why they think that slavery
shouldn't just be allowed but should be
positively encouraged because it's in
the Quran. and therefore um if you want
to be true to God's message, you should
have slavery. I mean, that's a very very
radical minority position. But it is an
example of the
um
the the the direction of travel that a
certain understanding of the Islamic
inheritance can lead people in. And
it's, you know, it's it's of course it's
a worry. But I I find this conversation
very valuable actually because what you
are actually explaining that even people
who go I'm an atheist. I don't believe
in God. I don't believe in Jesus Christ.
I reject all of that.
>> But you are still a product of
Christianity.
>> Yes.
>> And as a result of that you look at the
world whether you accept it or not
through Christian eyes.
>> Yes. And I don't think that people quite
understand what that means, particularly
when we look at religions like Islam or
we look at other cultures and we're
like, we're all the same.
>> We're not.
>> Well, so so that is I mean that is the
foundational principle of of whatever
our new religion is. This kinda this
this gilded mutated be kind, isn't
Paddington wonderful kinda
post-Christianity
>> that remains the the kinda the
dominant ideology. And I would say that
the par, you know, the paradigmatic
pulpit that this religion has is thought
for the day on radio 4's today program
>> where you will have
Catholic priests and Anglican bishops
and rabbis and Islamic scholars and um
Sikhs and Hindus
all preaching exactly same message. you
know, one will give it a little bit of
garnishing from the gospels, one from
the Quran, one from the um Bag Gita or
whatever, but basically it's it's the
same core message and the idea, you
know, and this is
>> and what is our message? Be kind,
diversified.
Yes, we're all we're all we're all
basically the same. There are many root
roots to God. Um there are many cars the
mountain.
>> Isn't that all true?
>> No, I don't think it's true. I think
that um
I think that
what the study of history reveals and
it's why it's so fascinating is the
infinite number of ways there are to be
human and the infinite number of ways
there are to order a society and that at
any given time the majority of people
who live in a particular place at a
particular time will assume that their
way of doing things is obviously the
standard way of doing it. Why wouldn't
you do it? And that's as true of
Athenians in fifth century Athens as it
is of um us today in 21st century
Britain. We just assume that the way we
see the world is the way that the world
is. But it clearly isn't. And you just
have to look at the world through the
eyes of um
I don't know Protestants in the 18th
century or Muslims in the 14th century
or Aztecs in the 15th century to realize
and to try and see the world through
their eyes and to realize how relative
one's own cultural assumptions are.
I mean it's a very powerful point. I
guess the next logical question is we've
got this new religion whatever this is
as you've said yourself but to me it
doesn't seem more a religion. It seems
kinda a mishmash of ideologies with no
rule.
>> That is what relations are.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I take I take you know
that's but there is no god. It's
>> but there is no God and and what I was
trying to say is there doesn't seem to
be a core
>> and I guess my question
>> it's floating. Yeah.
>> And I guess my my my question is
unpleasant as it may seem is can society
last without this core to it.
>> We will find out. I mean I would say
>> that's an optimistic answer. I mean I
would say that there are
I mean there are many many paths and
many paths that our society will take
because it's it's fracturing in all
kinds of ways.
>> Um you know there are many many
different perspectives.
>> Um and and those aren't just political,
they're cultural or all kinds of ways.
But I would say that say for for Britain
this ancient Christian country um
one one one
path is that um
this this kinda postChristian
Paddingtonism
>> if you want to call it that. Um,
it's
it's like the head of the rocket. It's
gone through the atmosphere. All
everything else underneath it has been
jettisoned and now it's got the power to
blast through the solar system
>> and all that kinda all all you know
all the stuff that's been jettisoned is
all the nonsense about the Bible and
Jesus and the church baggage. We don't
it's just baggage. It's gone. It's
drifted. It's, you know, it's it's
detritus.
um we have now blasted out and we're
going forward and um
the secular principles, the liberal
principles are sufficiently
self-evident,
self-evidently right and good that it
will sustain the future evolution and
development of our society for for
decades and centuries to come. And
therefore, you know, it it it's it's
culturally determined. I mean it's it's
it's
clearly derives from Christianity but
but you don't need Christianity anymore
to kinda provide the rocket fuel. It's
it's it's it's going on its own way.
Another another option which the history
of the 20th century suggests
is that the default assumption among
humans is that strength and might is
right. M
>> power does have a a glamour and this is
what nature predicted. You know he said
when Christian Christianity goes there
will be this great convulsion and there
will you know will be
terrifying powers will emerge and of
course he was right because they emerged
in the form of fascism and fascism and
Nazism cast such a shadow over us that
we've lived in their shadow. In a way,
one of the reasons I think for the
decline of institutional Christianity is
that Hitler has taken the place of the
devil. Um, and that that that a modern
liberal now rather than ask what would
Jesus do as his Victorian forebear would
have done says what would Hitler do and
does the opposite.
>> And that's kinda kept us on our
liberal straight and narrow. But that is
clearly fading as as the you know
experience of fascism becomes in Europe
becomes a you know dies out lived
experience of it. So the the the kinda
the bogeyman power of Hitler will fade
and
people who are no longer bounded by
Christian inhibitions or assumptions, I
can imagine them turning around and
saying, "Well, what's wrong with why
shouldn't I do what I like? I'm very
rich. I'm very powerful. Why shouldn't I
do exactly what I like?" And it's not
obvious what the answer to that is, I
think, if you don't have the kinda the
the the Christian answers. And I suppose
a third possibility is that um people
will return to the the source and say
well actually maybe
maybe I am Christian maybe I you know
maybe I should take this a bit more
seriously than I have been and there are
kinda I think tentative signs that
that might be happening.
>> What's fascinating is I would argue
there are signs of all three of those
things happening at
>> course and that's what I'm saying is
that all of these things might be
happening and of course we will also
have the growth of Islam. So that also
provides a fourth option. Um and quite
how all these different traditions will
cope with each other. I you know it's
going to be interesting.
>> But but doesn't it also
>> he seems very excited about this for
reasons that are beyond
>> you know you know I think I mean I think
I think we're living through one of the
>> you're going to get some fascists you're
going to get the rise of Islam. You're
going to get these woke idiots running
around ruining everything. And what was
the other one?
>> Oh the resurgence of Christianity. So
that's the one I'm
>> So I think most I think we are we are
living through a great choke point
>> in in the history of this country and of
of of this continent more generally
>> and western civilization aren't we?
>> Yeah absolutely. Uh and you know in
British terms of British history we've
had periods where
the the culture of say just looking
specifically at England has radically
changed. So the Norman conquest the
reformation the industrial revolution. I
think that that we are on the verge of
going through something similar now. Um
and I don't know where it's gonna go.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> You know, I mean people people in um you
know 1790
>> looking at Birmingham or Manchester
would have had no idea where that was
going. But it everything changed and and
maybe we're going through something
we're on the verge of going through
something similar now.
>> Well, at least you said it with a smile
on your face, Tom.
>> Brilliant. But I was going to say just
one thing. Doesn't this talk about an
arrogance of our culture
>> where
>> But all cultures are arrogant, right? I
was going to say that.
>> But they are. But aren't we especially
arrogant to think we can divorce societ?
>> That's your arrogance showing me.
>> Yes.
>> Am I not really special about thinking
I'm special?
>> Yeah, I am special. The mother said so,
but um No, she didn't. Uh but I was
going to say
>> explains the common career bit. But
thinking that we can surely aren't we
the only society that has ever thought
we can divulse culture and religion.
>> Yes.
>> Is that not arrogant?
>> Yeah, it is arrogant. But but the
arrogance people would say that's
justified because of the fact that that
that we have the most um we we're
products of the of an incredibly
advanced civilization that
industrialized um and therefore
basically we've you know we've we've got
the answer. And I think obviously that
that now rubs up against all kinds of
anxieties about um western
exceptionalism. But I think it does the
idea that um
our secular liberal society is
uniquely
advanced. I mean to be progressive is
itself a very western thing. And if
you're progressive you're progressing
ahead of everybody else.
>> I mean a sense of arrogance is baked
into that word I would argue.
Well, it's going to be a very
interesting time. Uh Tom, thank you so
much. It's always such a pleasure
speaking with you. We're going to ask
you a bunch of questions from our
supporters which they've submitted. Uh
but before we do, uh what's the one
thing that we're not talking about that
we really should be? Before Tom answers
a final question, at the end of the
interview, make sure to head over to our
Substack. The link is in the description
where you'll be able to see this. What's
required in the character traits of a
historian to engage hostile audiences
with their most controversial academic
insights?
>> Is Christianity's resurgence in the West
a response to Islam's growing presence?
>> What has Tom changed his mind about
during his career?
Uh well um have you talked about um the
uh cultural and social significance of
sport on your
>> We have not.
>> Um I I I think that because um
uh we've just had this incredible climax
to a cricket series. Um, and I went on
the Today program this morning to talk
about it and was reminded I I went to
the Oval yesterday where it was played
and sense of tension was unbearable
and I'd been through this um
quarterfinal in the Champions League
where Bill who we talking about earlier
had played against PSD and that also had
been so excruciating
>> and I realized that these are the two
moments where I have lived most fully
this year and that is I am just one
person among millions perhaps billions
who share in experiences like that and
it is obviously part of an enormous vast
global industrialized
um construct I mean it's enormous and
the way that this has evolved the fact
that we take it for granted I it
suddenly struck me this is very odd this
is this is something I've always taken
for granted That actually is very very
strange and unusual. So maybe maybe
something on that.
>> Excellent. Uh head on over to
triggerpod.co.uk where we ask Tom your
questions.
Apocalyptic millinarian cults have
played an important part of Western
Christianity's history and culture. Do
you see any similarities in today's
movements which would indicate the
emergence of such cults in the present
day?
