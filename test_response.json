This two-year project, valued at C$1.5 million (\u00a3814,000), aims to create bio-based building blocks to replace petroleum-derived materials for packaging and personal care applications, focusing on scalability, cost-effectiveness, and reducing fossil fuel dependence[1][9].\n\nAdditionally, researchers have developed a new bamboo-based bioplastic exhibiting exceptional mechanical strength, marking a notable advancement in bio-based materials with potential for durable applications[7].\n\nThere is also progress in improving bioplastic coatings for paper packaging: a proof-of-concept spray-coating process using PLA and PHA bioplastics enhances strength, oxygen resistance, and water resistance of paper packaging while maintaining compostability. The next step is to develop a water-based, solvent-free coating process to increase environmental safety and industrial scalability[5].\n\nThese developments reflect ongoing innovation in bioplastic materials, production methods, and applications, reinforcing the sector's momentum toward sustainable, high-performance alternatives to conventional plastics[1][5][7]."
