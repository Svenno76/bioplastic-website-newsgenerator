## Market Position

### Industry Leadership
BASF is identified as one of the top players in the global bioplastics market alongside:
- Corbion
- Danimer Scientific
- Mitsubishi Chemical
- Novamont
- Braskem
- Biome Bioplastics

### Market Size & Growth
- **2024:** $10.84 billion
- **2025:** $12.79 billion (projected)
- **2030:** Expected significant growth
- **2035:** Market projected to reach $65.4 billion (18.2% CAGR)

## Research & Development Focus

### Key Areas
1. Developing bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based plastics
2. Materials that are both bio-based and biodegradable
3. Exploring renewable raw materials:
   - Wood scraps
   - Dandelions
   - Glucose
   - Biomass feedstocks
4. Expanding white biotechnology research unit

### Bio-based vs Biodegradable
**Important Distinction:**
- **Bio-based plastics:** Made from renewable raw materials, but not necessarily biodegradable
- **Biodegradable plastics:** Can break down under specific conditions, regardless of source material
- BASF focuses on both categories

## Industry Context

### Global Bioplastics Production
- Current: Less than 1% of 300+ million metric tons of annual plastic production
- **2024:** ~2.47 million tonnes
- **2029:** Expected to reach ~5.73 million tonnes
- Represents only 0.5% of global plastic production (414 million tonnes total)

### Sustainability Impact
According to industry experts, if just 20% of the carbon in PET bottles worldwide were replaced by bio-based carbon:
- Would absorb 17.2 million metric tons of CO2 from the environment
- Equivalent to about 40 million barrels of oil savings

## Events & Conferences

### 19th European Bioplastics Conference (EBC24)
- **Date:** December 2024
- **Attendees:** Around 350 participants
- BASF participated as a key industry stakeholder
